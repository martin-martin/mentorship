## Scenario 1: Dazed and Confused
_Student:_ I’m feeling very overwhelmed by all of the material in this program. It seems like every time I learn something new, I forget how to do everything else from before that. Right now I can’t even seem to figure out how to submit the first project. It’s not supposed to be this hard, is it? What do I do?

---

Hei StudentName! - - Ah, yes..., I remember how this feels from when I was starting out myself! There's a lot of content in each program - and even more out there in the wide world... world wide... wow! 😮
Starting out with something new can easily feel overwhelming! But don't get discouraged by that!
Because, in a way, yes! - it's _supposed to be hard_. Why? - that's because you're here as a **learner**. You don't know the material yet, you're **learning new stuff**. And really _really_ learning something is actually somewhat of a struggle for your brain. There's a ton of work to do, it has to create new connections and strengthen useful ones. And struggling there on the way is a good thing! Research has shown that when you're struggling (and stick with it), you're learning a lot.
So maybe... 🤔 what you feel as exhaustion is just the compounded muscle-sore of all those little mind workers creating new connections here and there and everywhere! 💪

##### Okay, ouch - brain is sore, so what can you do?
1. Don't give up! And keep having fun while learning. These are the most important things.
2. Reach out to the Udacity community - both to other students, e.g. in the slack channels, as well as to Udacity Mentors on the Forums and in 1:1s. We're all a bunch of excited learners that know what this is like and who like to help if we can : )
3. Try to _generalize_ the topic you're trying to learn. Cut it down to its essentials. Make the most simple example you can think of that does a similar thing. That's an immensely great practice that helps in many aspects when coding and will be always helpful later on.
4. _Own_ the project you're working on. : ) Make it yours! Your task is to build a website using HTML and CSS? Build that website for your friend that he/she has always been dreaming of. Or for yourself! Don't worry if it isn't perfect - it won't be. But seeing the _reason_ for learning something very clearly, which works well when applying it to a personal idea, helps to put some extra 🔥 &nbsp; in your drive, plus you'll have something to show and look at. : )

Okay, that turned out to be a long response! 😳
Hope that there's something useful for you in there. Basically just keep in mind:

##### Tl;dr:
- once in a while you'll struggle when learning - that's a good thing because it means you're _learning_
- don't give up, and keep having fun. find ways to personalize your learning to supercharge your fun and retention
- reach out to other learners and coaches in the Udacity community. there are a lot of us out there, and it's nice and useful to learn together

: )

## Scenario 2: Mean Means
_Student:_ I’m not sure how to do this. The question asks for the mean of the following numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. How do I get the mean? How is that different from the average?

---

Hei! That's a great question! I bet a lot of us are wondering about what's the difference between the average and the mean.
Did you try to prop your question into a google search and check what the mighty interwebs return to you?

And can you think also about another approach to solving this question? Is there maybe something in the context of the task description that can help you figure out what is the aim of the exercise?

Give it a try, do a quick google search, and let me know whether that clears up your question (if it doesn't you can click to clear up the hint below!)!

## Scenario 3: Mindset Reset
You witness the following conversation between two students:

**Student A:** I’m trying to teach my friend how to code, but I’m not sure I know what I’m doing. I’ve never really taught before! I think the most difficult thing so far has been not knowing what to do if I don’t know the answer to a question my friend asks. Should I take my best guess? Should I look it up with her? How do other people who have taught or mentored handled moments like this?

**Student B:** Just my two cents, but if your friend has questions you don’t know the answer to, are you sure you should be mentoring? I guess I’ve never run into that situation when I’ve taught because I’ve been a developer for so long and have worked on so many hard projects.

---

Hei Student A and Student B. First of all I really think it's great of both of you that you're mentoring other people to get a better understanding of what it means to code - it's so important nowadays, and only getting more important! Kudos! 👍

Teaching is also a great way of learning - because you're in a social situation and you need to process and formulat the knowledge to make it understandable for someone else. There's a lot of stuff that I figured out I _don't_ know through trying to teach it to someone else 😅

That said - things change so fast in tech that you can _never know **everything**_. But, don't despair! That's actually not a problem. However, due to this fact, it's one of the most important things _to learn how to learn things_!
Identifying and acknowledging those white blobs on your mental map is the first step to filling them up - and it's an extremely important one, too!

So don't worry, Student A, if you don't have answers to the questions your friend asks. Let her know, go and look it up together, and thereby make it a lesson for both of you:
1. you get the chance to learn some new content
2. she gets the chance to learn some new content AND
3. she gets to see _**how to approach solving a question** you don't know the answer to_ (yet).

That **third point** is by far the **most important** one. There will always be more out there to learn out there, a new framework that you might need for a freelance job, or some novel development in Machine Learning that sounds exciting so that you want to follow along.

Your friend will soon understand that this might be the most valuable skill that anyone can teach to her in her budding programming career! : )

## Scenario 4: Travel Tips
You witness the following conversation between two students:

**Student A:** My family is headed on a trip to New Zealand in a few months, and we need some tips for where to go and what to do! We have two weeks and really love being out in nature and having interesting cultural experiences. Which cities should we visit, and where should we hike?

**Student B:** Queenstown, the capital city, is very much worth a visit! The waterfront area gives you some beautiful views of the ocean, and the food is excellent! The national museum called Te Papa is also there and super interesting. You can learn all kinds of things about New Zealand’s geography, animal and plant life, and history!

**HINT:** What is the capital of New Zealand? Take 2 minutes to research the place is Student B is referring to and then craft your response to best help Student A plan his or her trip.

---

Hei Student A!
I think that the city that Student B wanted to mention was [**Wellington**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington) (which is - [rightfully confusingly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_of_New_Zealand) - the capital of New Zealand). It's a beautiful, relatively small city that sits at the waterfront of [_Cook Strait_](https://goo.gl/maps/mytujR566JS2), tucked between the North and South Island. I was myself lucky enough to spend some time there, and enjoyed the city [heaps](http://www.nz.com/new-zealand/guide-book/language/dictionary.aspx#h). : )
It hosts a lot of cultural activities, for example the interesting [Te Papa Museum](https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/) that Student B mentioned.

And **Queenstown** is another great place to go in New Zealand that you should definitely check out - because there are tons of [outdoorsy things to do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queenstown,_New_Zealand#Tourism) there - just watch the background-video on their [official page](https://www.queenstownnz.co.nz/)! Nice 🏔 , ey?.

So here's my
#### Two-week-trip-tip

## Scenario 5: It's just too much
Student: This is all so frustrating! I don’t think I can figure any of this out. I’ve gone over and over the videos in this course, but I’m just not getting it. Every time I sit down to work on the project, I just can’t seem to remember what to do next. I guess I’m just not cut out for engineering.

---

😢
Nooooooooo - !
Don't let yourself get discouraged when you get stuck with a project. It's actually a very healthy and important part of learning!

## Scenario 6: Unsupportive Support
Student: Every time I ask for help at Udacity, mentors just confuse me and won’t give me the answers I need. If I can’t figure something out, tell me the solution! What is wrong with you people?

## Scenario 7: Margot's Strawberries
A student reaches out to you for help on the following problem:

_Margot loves strawberries and wants to buy as many as she can with the $8 she has in her pocket. If a pound of strawberries costs $6 and there are 18 strawberries in a pound, how many strawberries can she buy total? Hint: She can’t buy part of a strawberry :)_

So that you don't have to solve the problem yourself, we've provided you with the math that would be required to find the number of strawberries Margot can buy.

s = number of strawberries Margot buys
c = cost of one strawberry = cost of one pound of strawberries / number of strawberries per pound = 7/18
total cost = number of strawberries * cost of one strawberry
8 = c * s
8 = 7/18 * s
s = 144/7 = 20 4/7 = 20.57142857...

=> From this we see that Margot can buy 20 strawberries (we have to round down because she can't spend more than $8 and can't buy part of a strawberry!).

Below you'll find parts of your conversation with the student who is working on this problem. Your task is to help fill in some of the missing pieces at different stages of the conversation. Please submit your responses to the mentor prompt in each part.

### Part 1:
Student: I am just staring at this word problem and have no idea how to start or what to do. I keep reading through it and glazing over and feeling lost. Help?

_Mentor prompt #1: How would you help the student get started on this problem? Write your response to their latest message and/or a script of how you think the conversation would continue, and then tell us why you responded this way._

### Part 2:
Student: Okay, so I’ve written down s = # strawberries, c = cost per strawberry in dollars, c = 7/18, and 8 = c * s. But now what?

_Mentor prompt #2: How would you guide the student through the next stage of this problem? Write your response to their latest message and/or a script of how you think the conversation would continue, and then tell us why you responded this way._

### Part 3:
Student: I have s = 144/7. Is that it?

_Mentor prompt #3: How would you guide the student through the end of the interaction? Write your response to their latest message and/or a script of how you think the conversation would continue, and then tell us why you responded this way._
