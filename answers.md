## Scenario 1: Dazed and Confused
>_Student:_ I‚Äôm feeling very overwhelmed by all of the material in this program. It seems like every time I learn something new, I forget how to do everything else from before that. Right now I can‚Äôt even seem to figure out how to submit the first project. It‚Äôs not supposed to be this hard, is it? What do I do?


Hei StudentName! - - Ah, yes..., I remember how this feels from when I was starting out myself - and honestly I still sometimes feel it when I dive into a new topic! There's a lot of content in each program - and then even more out there in the wide world... world wide... wow! üòÆ&nbsp;üéÜ

Starting out with something new can easily feel overwhelming! But don't get discouraged by that!
Because, in a way, yes! - it's _supposed to be hard_.
Why? - that's because you're here as a **learner**. You don't know the material yet, you're **learning new stuff**. And really _really_ learning something is actually somewhat of a struggle for your brain. There's a ton of work to do: your brain has to create new connections and constantly strengthen useful ones. That's a lot of work - and research has shown that when you're struggling (and stick with it), you're actually learning a lot.

So maybe... ü§î&nbsp; what you feel as exhaustion is just the compounded muscle-sore of all those little mind workers creating new connections here and there and everywhere! üí™

##### Okay, but how to keep things rolling?
1. **Don't give up!** And keep having **fun** while learning. These are the most important things.
2. **Reach out** to the Udacity community - both to **other students**, e.g. in the slack channels, as well as to **Udacity Mentors** on the Forums and in 1:1s. We're all a bunch of excited learners that know what this is like and who like to help if we can : )
3. Try to **generalize the topic** you're trying to learn. Cut it down to its essentials. Make the _most simple example you can think of_ that does a similar thing. That's an immensely great practice that helps in many aspects when coding and will just keep being helpful later on.
4. **Own the project** you're working on. : ) **Make it yours!** - - E.g. let's say your task is to build a website using HTML and CSS? -> Build that one website for your friend that he/she has always been dreaming of. Or build one for yourself! And don't worry if it isn't perfect - _it won't be_. But, again, we're here to _learn_, and seeing the _reason_ for learning something very clearly helps to put some extra üî• &nbsp; in your drive! And that just works so much better when applying the projcet to a personal idea. Plus you'll have something to show and look at. : )

Whoops, that turned out to be a loooong response! üòÖ
Hope that there's something useful for you in there.

##### Too long; didn't read
Basically just keep in mind:

- once in a while **you'll struggle while learning - and that's a good thing** because it means you're _learning_
- **don't give up, and keep having fun**. find ways to personalize your learning to supercharge your fun and retention
- **reach out to other learners and coaches** in the Udacity community. there are a lot of us out there, and it's nice and useful to learn together

And of course: **use Google**!

:)

## Scenario 2: Mean Means
>_Student:_ I‚Äôm not sure how to do this. The question asks for the mean of the following numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. How do I get the mean? How is that different from the average?

Hei! That's a great question! I bet a lot of us are wondering about what's the difference between the average and the mean.
Did you try to prop your question into a google search and check what the mighty interwebs return to you?

And: can you also think of another approach to solving this question? Is there maybe something in the context of the task description that can help you figure out what is the aim of that exercise?

Give it a try, do a quick google search, and let me know whether that clears up your question _(if it doesn't you can click below to clear up the hidden hint!)_!

## Scenario 3: Mindset Reset
>You witness the following conversation between two students:

>**Student A:** I‚Äôm trying to teach my friend how to code, but I‚Äôm not sure I know what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôve never really taught before! I think the most difficult thing so far has been not knowing what to do if I don‚Äôt know the answer to a question my friend asks. Should I take my best guess? Should I look it up with her? How do other people who have taught or mentored handled moments like this?

>**Student B:** Just my two cents, but if your friend has questions you don‚Äôt know the answer to, are you sure you should be mentoring? I guess I‚Äôve never run into that situation when I‚Äôve taught because I‚Äôve been a developer for so long and have worked on so many hard projects.


Hei Student A and Student B. First of all I really think it's great of both of you that you're mentoring other people to get a better understanding of what it means to code - it's so important nowadays, and only getting more important! Kudos! üëç

**Teaching is also a great way of learning** - because you're in a social situation and you need to process and formulate the knowledge to make it understandable for someone else. There's a lot of stuff that I figured out I _don't_ know through trying to teach it to someone else üòÖ

There's one thing to come to terms with when breaking into tech - things change so fast that you can _never know **everything**_. But, don't despair! That's actually not a problem. It just makes it more clear that one of the most important things to learn, is _to learn how to learn things_!
Identifying and acknowledging those white blobs üí≠&nbsp; on your mental map is the first step to filling them up - and it's an extremely important one, too!

#### So here are my thoughts on teaching
>**You don't have to be a professional (XYZ) to "teach" - as long as you're a motivated and resourceful problem solver**. The most important skill to teach to someone, is to help them become self-sufficient in their own learning process.

So don't worry, Student A, if you don't have answers to the questions your friend asks. Just let her know that you don't know - and then go and look it up together. That way you'll turn the situation into a superpower-multi-faceted-lesson for both of you:
1. **you** get the chance to learn some new content AND
2. practice problem solving,
3. **she** gets the chance to learn some new content AND
4. gets to see that it's fine not to know everything AND
5. gets to see _**how to approach solving a question** that she doesn't know the answer to_ (yet).

There's more, of course. But that **fifth point** is by far the **most important** one. There will _always_ be more out there to learn, such as a new framework that you might need for a freelance job, or some novel development in Machine Learning that sounds so exciting so that you'll want to try to follow along.

Your friend will soon understand that it might be the most valuable skill that anyone can teach to her in her budding programming career! : )

## Scenario 4: Travel Tips
>You witness the following conversation between two students:

>**Student A:** My family is headed on a trip to New Zealand in a few months, and we need some tips for where to go and what to do! We have two weeks and really love being out in nature and having interesting cultural experiences. Which cities should we visit, and where should we hike?

>**Student B:** Queenstown, the capital city, is very much worth a visit! The waterfront area gives you some beautiful views of the ocean, and the food is excellent! The national museum called Te Papa is also there and super interesting. You can learn all kinds of things about New Zealand‚Äôs geography, animal and plant life, and history!

>**HINT:** What is the capital of New Zealand? Take 2 minutes to research the place is Student B is referring to and then craft your response to best help Student A plan his or her trip.


Hei Student A!
I think that the city that Student B wanted to mention was [**Wellington**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington) (which is - [rightfully confusingly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_of_New_Zealand) - the capital of New Zealand). It's a beautiful, relatively small city that sits at the waterfront of [_Cook Strait_](https://goo.gl/maps/mytujR566JS2), tucked in between the North and South Island. I was myself lucky enough to spend some time there, and enjoyed the city [heaps](http://www.nz.com/new-zealand/guide-book/language/dictionary.aspx#h). : )
It hosts a lot of cultural activities, for example the interesting [Te Papa Museum](https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/) that Student B mentioned.

But also **Queenstown** is a great place to go to in New Zealand. And I think that you should really check it out, because there are tons of [outdoorsy things to do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queenstown,_New_Zealand#Tourism) there - just watch the background-video on their [official page](https://www.queenstownnz.co.nz/)! Nice üèî , ey?.

Ok, So here's my:
#### Two-week-trip-tip

New Zealand is a great place both for interesting cultural experiences as well as nature stuff like hiking (and extreme sports, if you're into that!).

I'd **split the two weeks also geographically and thematically**, spend the first week on the North Island and soak in Kiwi and Maori culture (and maybe some thermal baths at Taupo), and then head South for week 2 and enjoy the natural beauty and opportunities for adventure sports on the South Island.

1. The **North Island** is home of the two biggest cities, Auckland and Wellington, so you'll easier find concerts and museums up there. And for unique New Zealandish cultural experiences you should try to find out about some local Maori cultural events, and if you want visit some of the more touristy villages such as Rotorua (still great thermal-boiled corn!). Maybe you can join a Hanga or watch a Kapa Haka performance somewhere, just keep your eyes and ears open.

2. The **South Island** obviously also has tons of culture, but there's so much beautiful nature there that it's easy to shift your focus. I'd personally recommend to check out the Marlborough Sounds, maybe take a drive across some high road in the center of the island, and make your way down to Milford Sound, which has great hiking trails and just a general wow to it. If you're into adventure sports, you could also stop over in Queenstown and maybe attach your feet to an elastic rope before plunging off a ledge (with a great view).

Oh dear... I'd have more to say (you can DM me if you want a day-by-day trip-tip, lol!), but you should probably look it up by yourself in order to find the things that you're really interested in! There is so much information about New Zealand on the web, people love to travel there, and rightfully so!
Check out some of those, and you can always ping me back if you have a specific question!

I wish you a great trip, take your time and enjoy!
:)

## Scenario 5: It's just too much
>Student: This is all so frustrating! I don‚Äôt think I can figure any of this out. I‚Äôve gone over and over the videos in this course, but I‚Äôm just not getting it. Every time I sit down to work on the project, I just can‚Äôt seem to remember what to do next. I guess I‚Äôm just not cut out for engineering.

Hei StudentName!
Whoops! Take care, you nearly dropped your motivation there!

You know, the truth is that no one is really cut out for engineering (or anything else, for that matter). It's all a big learning process, and if you want to become an engineer, you totally can! : D

It'll take some time and it'll take some effort - but learning anything new does! Sometimes it may feel a little frustrating, but keep in mind that there's a community here that is happy to support you and help you on the way. It also helps me to remember that struggling really means that my brain is setting up new pathways - the process of working on gradually understanding something more is a great workout for the brain. I bet there's been a lot happening in your mind while you tried to wrap your head around this new content.

As for actually doing a project, what usually helps me a lot is to **clearly write out the steps I think are necessary** before starting to work on it. This puts my brain into the right mode and I'll easily see which steps I somewhat understand and where I'm still lacking something. Then I can go and research more on those points: Look up _specifically_ the related course videos, check in other places online, search the Forums for other students who had the same questions, or maybe even ask a question if it hasn't been talked about yet.
Once I think that I have a generally idea of what to do for the project, and think that I somewhat understand what each of the steps entails - _then_ I start to work on it.

Often I still get stuck and realize that something didn't quite go the way I originally thought it would - but having the rough plan is a great guideline that helps to tag along and avoid getting lost. If you're more dilligent than me, you can even cast it into a neat time plan, broken up by the different steps, and I know people who swear that this works even better! Personally I still need to learn something there about time management üòÖ&nbsp;, but it's on my radar! So:

#### To avoid feeling overwhelmed
1. Set your aim (e.g. "Finish Project 3")
2. Make a rough outline of the work that needs to be done
3. Break it down in small and achievable steps
4. Set a timeline for each of them
5. And then follow along your outline! : )

Like that, if you ever get stuck on the way, it'll also be much easier to look up specific questions that relate to the part that you're currently working on.
And you'll see that if the steps to achieve your goal are somewhat clear in front of you, it becomes much easier to walk the path, and the task(s) will feel much less overwhelming.

Hope this helps, let me know! : )

 ## Scenario 6: Unsupportive Support
>Student: Every time I ask for help at Udacity, mentors just confuse me and won‚Äôt give me the answers I need. If I can‚Äôt figure something out, tell me the solution! What is wrong with you people?

Hei StudentName!
When someone in the community gives you a tip, or a link, rather than presents the solution, we're actually **trying to help out in the most efficient way!**
When you don't (yet) know how to do something, that's when your brain is working the hardest. And that brain work is essential for learning - it's like training your muscles: they only grow when you regularly exercise and push yourself a little.

So, even though it would sometimes feel nice to just have the answer served so it can get you moving forward _in that moment_, in the _long term_ this doesn't help much.

Here at Udacity our foremost goal is to help our students to become **self-sufficient learners**! We want you to feel confident to venture out there and tackle new challenges by yourself. For that it's essential to learn how to approach a question to figure out the solution by yourself. That's also what will make you _actually remember_ how stuff works, and allow you to apply that learning in new situations.
Because learning to become successful is not about knowing all the answers, but about being resourceful and confident in **knowing how to get there**.

And that's what mentors are here for:
- To try to ask the right questions back,
- try to point you into the right direction,
- speak the right hint at the right time,
- and send you off into the world wild web, equipped with a solid link and a curious mindset, so you can venture, explore, and learn by yourself
- but also so you'll know that you can always come back and find a safe spot here in our community : )

I hope this makes it more clear why we don't directly give the answers - in the long-term it's really much more helpful, exciting, and sustainable, to learn how to dig for and uncover those treasures - I mean: _answers_ - by yourself.

**You'll always be welcome to ask questions if you get stuck**, and we'll try to give you a map&nbsp;üó∫ &nbsp;, some (hopefully) smart words for the path (e.g.: _"If it looks like a snake üêç,&nbsp;, don't step on it!"_ - - - _"Thanks, mom..."_ üôÑ &nbsp;), hand you a bottle of motivation, and then point into a good direction üëâ&nbsp;. And then the world is yours to explore! (And we're excited to get a call once in a while and hear how it's going!) : )

## Scenario 7: Margot's Strawberries
>A student reaches out to you for help on the following problem:

>_Margot loves strawberries and wants to buy as many as she can with the $8 she has in her pocket. If a pound of strawberries costs $6 and there are 18 strawberries in a pound, how many strawberries can she buy total? Hint: She can‚Äôt buy part of a strawberry :)_

>So that you don't have to solve the problem yourself, we've provided you with the math that would be required to find the number of strawberries Margot can buy.

>s = number of strawberries Margot buys
c = cost of one strawberry = cost of one pound of strawberries / number of strawberries per pound = 7/18
total cost = number of strawberries * cost of one strawberry
8 = c * s
8 = 7/18 * s
s = 144/7 = 20 4/7 = 20.57142857...

>=> From this we see that Margot can buy 20 strawberries (we have to round down because she can't spend more than $8 and can't buy part of a strawberry!).

>Below you'll find parts of your conversation with the student who is working on this problem. Your task is to help fill in some of the missing pieces at different stages of the conversation. Please submit your responses to the mentor prompt in each part.

### Part 1:
>Student: I am just staring at this word problem and have no idea how to start or what to do. I keep reading through it and glazing over and feeling lost. Help?

>_Mentor prompt #1: How would you help the student get started on this problem? Write your response to their latest message and/or a script of how you think the conversation would continue, and then tell us why you responded this way._

### Part 2:
>Student: Okay, so I‚Äôve written down s = # strawberries, c = cost per strawberry in dollars, c = 7/18, and 8 = c * s. But now what?

>_Mentor prompt #2: How would you guide the student through the next stage of this problem? Write your response to their latest message and/or a script of how you think the conversation would continue, and then tell us why you responded this way._

### Part 3:
>Student: I have s = 144/7. Is that it?

>_Mentor prompt #3: How would you guide the student through the end of the interaction? Write your response to their latest message and/or a script of how you think the conversation would continue, and then tell us why you responded this way._
